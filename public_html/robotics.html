                <p> 
                    In high school I was a member of FIRST Robotics Team 192 where I worked with a team to build hundred-pound robots for an annual competition on a six-week time frame. As head welder, design lead for one of the robot components, and machinist, my responsibilities taught me advanced mechanical design, implementation, and team management. During my two years on the team, I made it a goal to familiarize myself with as many mechanical engineering skills as possible, so I learned manual machining, CNC machining and g-code, CAD, welding, pneumatics, and drive train design. These skills have unequivocally helped me in developing my technical expertise in a variety of fields including chemistry and electrical engineering.
