                <p> 
                    Thesis is the year-long independent research project that acts as the capstone course for my Reed College education. Presently I am working under the guidance of Dr. Sameh Helmy to create a photoresponsive polymer that reversibly contracts upon exposure to light, with anticipated completion in May 2018. As an independent research project, thesis develops my skills in primary research, project management, experimental design and troubleshooting, and technical due diligence. Every day of my self-directed schedule I am responsible for planning and carrying out necessary experiments or analyses. In addition to these management skills, this project provides me valuable experience in material science and organic synthesis.

                    The first part of the thesis project is a proof of concept using azobenzene as the photoresponsive molecule. The proof of concept consists of synthesizing a functionalized form of azobenzene known as divinylazobenzene (above left), which will enable it to be polymerized. Next, the divinylazobenzene will be polymerized with off-the-shelf styrene (above right) to form divinylazobenzene-crosslinked polystyrene. Because the azo (-N=N-) link in the cross-linker bends in response to light, this polymer should show a general contraction when lit.

                    <p><em>Second product is polymerized DASA with styrene.</em></p>
                </div>   
                <p> 
                    The second part of the project is performing a similar crosslinked polymerization using DASAs (above left), a recently-developed class of photoresponsive molecule <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo502206g">(Helmy et al 2014)</a>. Once the photoactive azobenzene polymer proof of concept is complete, work can commence on synthesizing and polymerizing the functionalized DASA, more complex yet better performing photoresponsive molecule.

                <p> 
                    Once these polymers are made, their photoresponses can be characterized. After that, an oral defense and written thesis are all that remain before finishing Reed.
