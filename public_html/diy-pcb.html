                <h1>DIY PCB PRODUCTION</h1>

                <p> 
                    Before I began using the fast and affordable PCB printing facilities I use today, I developed a technique for DIY PCB lithographic etching using concentrated ferric chloride and Reed College's laser cutter. First, a sheet of copper-laminated fiberglass (the raw PCB) was coated with spray paint enamel as a mask. This enamel was ablated away using the laser cutter in the appropriate pattern, and the soot wiped away with isopropanol. The masked board was then immersed in concentrated ferrous chloride and stroked rhythmically with a brush for about ten minutes to etch away the unmasked copper. The remaining enamel mask was then washed off with acetone. Finally, the PCB was finished by drilling any holes and cutting away edges using a sheet metal shear. Altogether, the process takes about an hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This process produced crude PCBs that were one-sided and featured no solder mask, but did the job for PCB prototyping before I started using commercial PCB manufacturing. Though companies such as PCBWay now can offer me fast and affordable PCB production, I keep this technique in my arsenal for whenever I need a same-day crude prototype done.
