                <p> 
                    The mobile phones are a current project to take a pair of old-school landline telephones and connect them via battery-powered ESP wifi modules to make them wireless. This project will become a public art piece that will enable participants to talk to one another across a distance through rogue old-fashioned telephones. I am working with Danny Andreev as a partner to make this project a reality.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    To date, we have established methods of reading the phone's microphone with an ESP and beaming a stream of microphone data to a central server. Tasks remaining include establishing an interface with the speaker using the ESP's built-in PWM, as well as testing our streaming protocol for robustness and resilience against fluctuating network speeds and ping times. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Due to setbacks from an already-filled schedule, this project has temporarily been put on hold. Expect updates within the next few weeks!
