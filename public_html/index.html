                        Thesis is the year-long independent research project that acts as the capstone course for my Reed College education. Presently I am working under the guidance of Dr. Sameh Helmy to create a photoresponsive polymer that reversibly contracts upon exposure to light, with anticipated completion in May 2018.

As head welder, design lead for one of the robot components, and machinist, my responsibilities taught me advanced mechanical design, implementation, and team management.
